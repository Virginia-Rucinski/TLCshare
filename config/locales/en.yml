# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

# About
  caregiving_in_us: Caregiving in the U.S.
  aarp: AARP Public Policy Institute
  2015_Report: 2015 Report
  key_findings: III. Key Findings
  prevelence_of_caregiving: Prevalence of Caregiving
  estimated: An estimated
  million: 43.5 million adults in the United States have provided unpaid care
  adult_or_child: to an adult or a child in the prior 12 months.
  basicts_caregiving: Basics of the Caregiving Situation
  majority_of_caregivers: The majority of caregivers
  are_female: are female (60%), but 40 percent are male. Eight in 10 are taking care of one person (82%). They 
  are_49: are 49 years of age,
  on_average_large: on average. A large majority of caregivers provide care for a relative (85%), with 49 percent caring for a parent or parent-in-law. One in 10 provides care for a spouse. Higher-hour caregivers are almost four times as likely to be caring for a spouse/partner.
  nearly_1_in_10: Nearly 1 in 10 caregivers is 75 years of age or older (7%). [...]


  how_long: How long have all caregivers of adults been in their role?
  on_average_4: On average, they have been in their role for 4 years,
  with_a_quarter: with a quarter having provided care for 5 years or more (24%).  Higher-hour caregivers are twice as likely to have been in their caregiving role for 10 or more years.

  typical_care_recipient: The typical care recipient is female (65%) and averages 69.4 years of age. Nearly half of caregivers provide care to someone 75 years old or older (47%). Roughly half of care recipients live in their own home (48%). However, as hours of care increase, so do the chances that the care recipient co-resides with the caregiver.

  primary_caregiver_status: Primary Caregiver Status

  over_six_in_10: Over six in 10 caregivers perceive themselves to be the primary unpaid caregiver, 
  meaning_either: meaning either that they are sole caregivers (47%) or that there are other unpaid caregivers, but they themselves provide the majority of unpaid care (16%).
  the_37_percent: The 37 percent who are non-primary caregivers includes 12 percent who share caregiving equally with someone else and 25 percent who say another caregiver provides most of the unpaid care.
  three_out_of_four: Three out of four higher-hour caregivers are their recipient’s primary caregiver, more so than lower-hour caregivers (56%).
 
  foot_note_7: 7 As with prior Caregiving in the U.S. studies, prevalence estimates are inclusive of those having provided in the 12 months before the time they were surveyed, whether they were currently a caregiver at the time of survey or had been a caregiver in the prior 12 months but no longer were. 8 Add the estimated 13.9% caring for an adult only plus the 2.7% caring for both a child and adult to get the total prevalence estimate of caring for an adult. 9 Higher-hour caregivers are those providing 21 or more hours of care weekly, while lower-hour caregivers are those providing 0–20 hours of care.
